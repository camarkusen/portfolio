                              The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has been ranked one of the world's preeminent international policy institutions; regularly called upon by Congress, the executive branch, and the media to offer bipartisan recommendations to improve U.S. and international strategy.<br/><br/>The Andreas C. Dracopoulos iDeas Lab is CSIS's internal digital agency; responsible for producing all creative content for the Center. A Graphic Design internship in the iDeas lab provides copious exposure to all aspects of professional design work-flow; from interacting with high-level clients across all 51 programs, to creating material that pushes the frontier of modern design while remaining sophisticated and diplomatic.

                              I joined the Entrepreneurs Society (then called The Entrepreneurship Society) in my 2nd year as the Head of Events. Quickly realizing there was a need for rebranding, I moved on to become the Head of Marketing and Design, completely rebranding the society as we moved from an affiliation of The Management Society to become an independent group. With the help of Entrepreneurs President Lamiaa Benmouaz, I fully redesigned the society logo, produced all marketing material with a distinct brand, and created a society website. This experience turned out to be my launching pad into the world of Graphic Design; providing invaluable experience in terms of directing the creation of professional content, receiving feedback and collaborating with others.

                              The Brenton Arboretum is a gorgeous nature sanctuary  located outside of Dallas Center, Iowa. I was asked to create the logo and event materials for their 20th anniversary celebration, entitled June Moon. I used the existing arboretum logo to create a special event logo for the project. It was extremely well-received, and showcases my ability to illustrate, as well as create cohesive branding and professional logos.

                              After seeing work that I had created around the University, The Feminist Book Club approached me about designing a logo for their newly formed group. I believe the finished product is an excellent example of my ability to discuss ideas and coax creative plans from clients who may not possess knowledge of Graphic Design language. It also demonstrates my illustrative skills, which were utilized in fulfilling her vision.<br/><br/>My client had a vision for how she wanted to brand her Club, and my ability to listen, understand, and deliver allowed me to fulfill her vision and create a logo we were both extremely excited about.
