            The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has been ranked one of the world's preeminent international policy institutions; regularly called upon by Congress, the executive branch, and the media to offer bipartisan recommendations to improve U.S. and international strategy. The Andreas C. Dracopoulos iDeas Lab is CSIS's internal digital agency; responsible for producing all creative content for the Center. A Graphic Design internship in the iDeas lab provides copious exposure to all aspects of professional design work-flow; from interacting with high-level clients across all 51 programs, to creating material that pushes the frontier of modern design while remaining sophisticated and diplomatic. The Iranian Missile graphic was the first project for which <span style="color:#f24000">I was given full responsibility</span>; due to the success of my work, I was then put in charge of creating a second graphic on North Korea, a third on China, and finally a fourth on Russia. The Missile Defense Project originally came to the iLab hoping to visually illustrate the ranges of Iran's ballistic missiles, with the goal of creating a graphic that provided copious amounts information while remaining legible and interesting. The graphic was to reach a thoroughly diverse audience; from policy-makers on the Hill to researchers and journalists Online <span style="color:#f24000">(the North Korean graphic was even published by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-missile-arsenal-graphic-2016-12">Business Insider,</a> and was copied by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/20/asia/north-korea-rocket-engine/">CNN</a>)</span>. Working with these challenges, I illustrated each missile and created four graphics that amalgamated a wealth of information into a professional yet modern design; not only capturing the attention of CSIS, but gathering incredibly positive feedback in the field. These graphics have been noted by our team as being <span style="color:#f24000">a quintessential example of what we are trying to achieve in the iLab: fostering interest and awareness through innovative design</span>.

            The following are a selection of report covers I designed for multiple programs at CSIS. Some of these reports were <span style="color:#f24000">published through the Library of Congress</span>, and all were distributed to countless researchers and policy-makers throughout the D.C. area, as well as to the entirety of CSIS's Online networking database.<br/><br/>Working on report covers helped to develop my understanding of <span style="color:#f24000">how to solve a multitude of print design challenges</span>, such as laying text over busy images, and adjusting font characteristics to achieve maximum legibility. I also greatly improved my photo research skills, as each report required finding an open source image that fit both the request and the writing. Furthermore, I learned how to edit images and even expand them using Photoshop to create more open space for text.<br/><br/>Here is a selection of my favorite designs.The iLab is constantly creating visual material for the huge variety of websites, reports, and events we work with. Producing this content was an opportunity to learn how to represent data in a visually interesting way; <span style="color:#f24000">synthesizing modern design with professional output</span>. One of the most exciting parts about CSIS is that the information we release is important, influencing policy domestically and abroad. Therefore our responsibility was to <span style="color:#f24000">use design innovation to foster interest and make a statement;</span> a skill that will undoubtedly be beneficial in future endeavors.

              The Brenton Arboretum is a gorgeous nature sanctuary  located outside of Dallas Center, Iowa. I was asked to create the logo and event materials for their 20th anniversary celebration, entitled June Moon. I used the existing arboretum logo to create a special event logo for the project. It was extremely well-received, and showcases my ability to illustrate, as well as create cohesive branding and professional logos.

            CSIS hosts a huge variety of events throughout the yearfor numerous important groups of people, <span style="color:#f24000">including board members, investors, and policy-makers</span>. The iLab produces this huge variety of event content, allowing me to gain an in-depth understanding of how print layouts are created for different needs. Beginning with template designs and moving on to produce my own original content, I learned how to introduce a modern feel within a traditional setting, creating designs that were professional, yet simultaneously interesting and fresh. Furthermore, I continued to develop my communication skills, collaborating with superiors along all stages of the production process. Designing event materials often required many levels of creation; editing logos into one cohesive watermark, adding elements to original images, and illustrating icons etc. Throughout my internship I learned how to place these assets into a design without losing quality, and how to navigate and create layers of design without sacrificing organization. This in turn  helped to <span style="color:#f24000">develop my skills as a team-player and contributor within a Design Team</span>.

            While at CSIS, I began <span style="color:#f24000">teaching myself basic coding skills in my free time</span>. This was noticed by our Director of Technology, who soon started utilizing me for web development support. This was an extremely proud moment for me; my proaction and determination to learn something new was <span style="color:#f24000">recognized by a superior, and I was able to quickly learn the basics of HTML, CSS and jQuery, as well as regularly support the development team</span>. Soon I was being asked to edit interactive graphics, writing flexbox code and problem-solving using techniques for responsive design. The depth of my knowledge can be seen in this portfolio website, which <span style="color:#f24000">I fully coded from scratch</span>.
